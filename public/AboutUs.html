          Arioso Cafe is a small roaster based in Vancouver, Canada. The Chief
          Roaster, Don Parkhurst has been small batch roasting for family,
          friends as well as for his own personal enjoyment, for almost 20
          years.

          Don’s other job as an airline pilot for the last 30 years, has had him
          travelling around the world and enjoying espresso at some of the
          finest coffee houses on the planet. Aside from enjoying the
          hand-crafted espresso drinks at some excellent cafes, it also inspires
          and drives him to create the finest roast possible whether it is for
          our own unique espresso blend (Bossa Nova Espresso) or any of our
          single origin coffees.

          At Arioso we only buy select small lots of fair trade/fair trade
          organic beans, which has allowed us to keep the highest possible
          quality in our roasts and to ensure a fair return for the great
          product grown by these farmers.
